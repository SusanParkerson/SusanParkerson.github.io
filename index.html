<h2>Notes on playing the games on this website</h2>
<p> The games on this website are Unity Web Player builds. To play one, you will need to open it in a browser that supports Unity WebGL. Chrome does not work, by default. I recommend Firefox. But if you really want to use Chrome, I've heard that there is a way to get Chrome to work, with the information here:</p>

<h2>Asteroids</h2>
<P>This is a game similar to the old Asteroids game. I made it with C# and Unity. It was a programming assignment for a Coursera class. Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the spaceship, space-bar to apply thrust, and left-ctrl key to fire. Good luck!</P>

<P>Another remake of an old game, developed with C# and Unity. It was a programming assignment for a Coursera class. Have fun!</P>
